# Virtualization vs. Containers

## Comparison Table

| Category            | Virtual Machines (VMs)                                                  | Containers                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture        | Each VM includes its own Guest Operating System and virtual hardware.   | Containers share the Host Operating System kernel while running isolated applications. |
| Boot Time           | Usually takes minutes because a complete operating system must start.   | Usually takes seconds because only the application and its dependencies need to start. |
| Resource Efficiency | Heavy and requires more RAM and storage because each VM has its own OS. | Lightweight and uses fewer resources because containers share the host OS kernel.      |
| Isolation Level     | Provides hardware-level virtualization and strong isolation.            | Provides process-level isolation while sharing the host OS kernel.                     |

## Summary

Containers can be a practical option for web applications because they start faster and generally use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines. Unlike VMs, containers do not require a separate operating system for every application. This allows organizations to run more applications on the same infrastructure while making deployment faster and more portable. For web applications that can run safely with container-level isolation, containerization can simplify deployment and improve resource efficiency.
